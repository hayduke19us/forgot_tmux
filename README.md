Forgot Tmux is a script that helps you set up your tmux configuration file. It also provides you with a quick reference to tmux commands. There are two current options:

SimpleWalk: creates a .tmux.conf file and walks you thru the 
configuration process of binding keys with notes.

AutoSimple: creates a .tmux.conf file and automatically
populates the file with most necessary key bindings.

Getting Started:

1.Clone the repository into your $HOME dir.  
 git clone https://github.com/hayduke19us/tmux_setup.git

2.In the command line:
ruby ~/tmux_setup/trail_head/setup.rb

3.Finished!
