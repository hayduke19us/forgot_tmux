# forgot_tmux

  Forgot Tmux is a script that helps you set up your tmux configuration file. It also provides you with a quick reference to tmux commands. There are two current options:

**SimpleWalk**: creates a .tmux.conf file and walks you thru the configuration process of binding keys with notes.

**AutoSimple**: creates a .tmux.conf file and automatically
populates the file with most necessary key bindings.
